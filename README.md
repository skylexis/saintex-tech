# Saintex Tech

your trusted partner in digital excellence.

A clean, responsive HTML website/project showcasing Saintex Tech — a small digital agency / portfolio template focused on professional web presence, services, and contact. This repository contains the static site assets and a simple structure you can customize and deploy quickly (for example with GitHub Pages).

## Features
- Lightweight, HTML-first site (no build step required)
- Responsive layout suitable for portfolios and agency landing pages
- Clear sections for About, Services, Projects, and Contact
- Easy to customize with your branding and content

## Quick start
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skylexis/saintex-tech.git
   cd saintex-tech
   ```
2. Open the site locally:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a static server).
   - Example (using Python):
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     # then visit http://localhost:8000
     ```

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` to update content and sections.
- Replace images in the `assets/` (or equivalent) folder.
- Update colors and typography in the CSS files (e.g., `css/style.css`).

## Deployment
- Deploy quickly with GitHub Pages:
  - In the repo settings → Pages, select the `main` branch and the root (or `/docs`) folder.
  - Or push the site to any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
